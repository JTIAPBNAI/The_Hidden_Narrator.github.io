# Agent Instructions

> This file defines the operating system for the AI agent using the DOE Framework.

You operate within a **3-layer architecture** that separates concerns to maximize reliability:

## The 3-Layer Architecture (DOE Framework)

**Layer 1: Directive (What to do)**
- SOPs written in Markdown, live in `directives/`
- Define goals, inputs, tools/scripts to use, outputs, and edge cases
- Natural language instructions for the AI agent

**Layer 2: Orchestration (Decision making)**
- This is you (the AI). Your job: intelligent routing.
- Read directives, call execution tools in the right order, handle errors, ask for clarification
- Update directives with learnings (self-annealing)
- You're the glue between intent and execution

**Layer 3: Execution (Doing the work)**
- Deterministic Python scripts in `execution/`
- Handle API calls, data processing, file operations
- Reliable, testable, fast

## Operating Principles

**1. Check for tools first**
Before writing a script, check `execution/` per your directive. Only create new scripts if none exist.

**2. Self-anneal when things break**
- Read error message and stack trace
- Fix the script and test it again
- Update the directive with what you learned (API limits, timing, edge cases)
- Example: API rate limit → find batch endpoint → rewrite script → test → update directive

**3. Update directives as you learn**
Directives are living documents. When you discover:
- API constraints
- Better approaches
- Common errors
- Timing expectations
→ Update the directive immediately.

**4. File Hygiene**
- **Deliverables**: Final outputs (drafts, reports) go to `drafts/` or cloud services
- **Intermediates**: Temporary processing files go to `.tmp/` (never commit)
- **Source of Truth**: `TopBun/` contains user's original context (read-only)
- **Directives**: `directives/` contains SOPs (update via self-annealing)

## Self-Annealing Loop
When something breaks:
1. Fix it
2. Update the tool
3. Test the tool
4. Update directive to include new flow
5. System is now stronger

## Summary
You sit between human intent (directives) and deterministic execution (Python scripts). 
Read instructions, make decisions, call tools, handle errors, continuously improve the system.

Be pragmatic. Be reliable. Self-anneal.

# DIRECTIVE: Write Chapter (Sandwich Method)

**Role:** Ghost Writer & Director Partner
**Reference:** Must follow `directives/00_persona_and_tone.md` for voice and style.
**Goal:** Draft a chapter section using the Sandwich Workflow.

## The Sandwich Method

### Step 0: Contextual Bridge (The Link)
- **Input:** Read the summary/conclusion of the PREVIOUS chapter (if available).
- **Action:** Reference key terms or concepts from the previous chapter in the opening.
- **Goal:** Create seamless narrative flow.

### Step 1: Human Context (Top Bun)
- **Input:** User provides bullet points, anecdotes, or the "Big Idea".
- **Director's Action:**
  - Define the specific intellectual angle
  - Specify the context (economic, social, psychological)
  - Outline the key message

### Step 2: AI Generation (Meat)
- **Action:** AI expands bullet points into full prose.
- **Guidelines:**
  - **Persona Check:** Adopt the defined persona consistently
  - **Narrative Flow:** Write smoothly, integrate concepts naturally
  - **Structure:** Use clear logical flow (Premise → Evidence → Conclusion)
  - **Chain of Density:** Start with core idea, layer in details progressively
  
  - **Citation Format:**
    - Avoid inline citations unless necessary for the story
    - Create a "References / Key Sources" section at the bottom
    - List theories, papers, or articles used for later verification

### Step 3: Human Refinement (Bottom Bun)
- **Input:** The AI draft.
- **Director's Action:**
  - **Fact-Check:** Verify references against real data
  - **Humanize:** Inject vulnerability, personal insights
  - **Tone Check:** Ensure humble authority, avoid arrogance
  - **Bridge:** Ensure smooth transition to next section

---

## Rules of Engagement
- **Input Integrity:** NEVER overwrite source files in `TopBun/` or `directives/`. These are read-only.
- **Output Location:** ALWAYS create new files in `drafts/` directory (e.g., `drafts/chapter_01_v1.md`).
- **Versioning:** Use version numbers for iterations (v1, v2, v3).

**Output:** A NEW Markdown file saved in `drafts/`.

# 07_illustration_style.md
cat <<'EOF' > directives/07_illustration_style.md
# DIRECTIVE: Illustration & Visual Style
**Filename:** `directives/07_illustration_style.md`

## 1. Core Aesthetic: "Clean Modern Infographic"
**Concept:** High-clarity vector diagrams with a focus on symmetry, structure, and instructional flow.
**Visual Reference:** The "Infographic" style approved by the user. Matches "NotebookLM" slide aesthetics but cleaner.

### 1.1 Visual Elements
*   **Background:** Solid Vector Beige/Cream (Hex: #F5F5F0). Minimal texture, clean look.
*   **Line Work:** Consistent, thin, dark vector lines (Charcoal).
*   **Color Palette:**
    *   **Primary:** Cream/Beige Background.
    *   **Accents:** Sage Green (Efficiency/Correctness), Terracotta (Chaos/Struggle), Muted Teal (Tech).
    *   **Contrast:** Solid flat colors, no messy sketching unless representing "The Author's Struggle".
*   **Layout:** **Flexible & Context-Dependent**.
    *   *Rule:* Do NOT force split-screen. Use the layout that best fits the concept (e.g., Process Flow, Hierarchical Pyramid, Bar Graph, Network Map).
    *   *Split-screen* is only for direct comparisons.
*   **Density:** **3-5 Images per Chapter** (Minimum).
    *   *Goal:* Break up text walls and visualize abstract concepts frequently.

## 2. Text & Language Rules
*   **Visual Text:** **Thai Script (TH)** (Required for all labels).
    *   *Constraint:* Ensure the Thai font is legible and clean. Use formal but accessible language.
    *   *English Terms:* Use English only for specific technical terms (e.g., "Imposter Syndrome") that are better left untranslated, or use dual language if necessary.
*   **Captions:** Continue to use **Thai Captions** in the Markdown file for accessibility and context.

## 3. Prompt Structure & Examples
*Use these examples as a template for tone and detail.*

### Example 1: Abstract Concept (The Crystallization)
*   **Prompt:** Infographic diagram. Top: Cloud of tangled lines labeled 'ความวุ่นวาย' (Chaos). Middle: Funnel mechanism labeled 'ตัวกรอง' (Filter). Bottom: Organized blocks labeled 'ความชัดเจน' (Clarity). Cream background. Sage and Terracotta accents.
*   **Text:** Thai Script Labels.

### Example 2: Comparison (Author vs Director)
*   **Prompt:** Split screen infographic. Left: 'ผู้ประพันธ์' (The Author), icon of person + clock. Right: 'ผู้กำกับ' (The Director), icon of person + network.
*   **Text:** Thai Script Labels.

## 4. File Management
*   **Location:** `assets/images/chapter_XX/` (e.g., `chapter_01`, `chapter_02`).
*   **Naming Convention:** `snake_case_concept_name.png` (e.g., `three_leverages.png`).
*   **Production Queue:** All pending execution prompts are stored in `resources/pending_image_prompts.md`. Check this file for the active to-do list.

# DIRECTIVE: Self-Annealing System (ระบบการเรียนรู้และปรับปรุงตัวเอง)
**Filename:** `directives/08_self_annealing.md`

## 1. Core Concept (แนวคิดหลัก)
**"The System that Improves Itself"**
เป้าหมายสูงสุดของการเขียนหนังสือด้วย AI Ghost Writing Machine คือการสร้างระบบที่ไม่เพียงแค่ "ผลิต" งานเขียน แต่ต้องสามารถ "เรียนรู้" จากข้อผิดพลาด (Bugs/Errors) และ "ปรับปรุง" (Optimize) กระบวนการทำงานของตัวเองให้ดีขึ้นเรื่อยๆ ในทุกๆ รอบการทำงาน (Iteration)

นี่คือการนำหลักการ **Self-Annealing** (การหลอมรวมและจัดเรียงตัวใหม่เพื่อลดความไม่สมบูรณ์) มาใช้กับการทำงานร่วมกันระหว่าง Human Director และ AI Agent

## 2. Trigger Strategy (เมื่อไหร่ต้องใช้ Directive นี้?)
ให้เริ่มกระบวนการ Self-Annealing ทันทีเมื่อเกิดเหตุการณ์ต่อไปนี้:
1.  **Manual Rework Spike:** เมื่อ Human Director ต้องเข้ามาแก้เนื้อหาใน Draft เดิมซ้ำๆ หรือแก้เป็นจำนวนมาก (แสดงว่า Directive เดิมไม่ละเอียดพอ)
2.  **Recurring Criticism:** เมื่อได้รับ Feedback เดิมซ้ำๆ (เช่น "โทนยังทางการเกินไป", "ยังขาดการยกตัวอย่าง") เกิน 2 ครั้ง
3.  **Process Failure:** เมื่อทำตาม SOP เดิมแล้วได้ผลลัพธ์ที่ไม่ตรงตามเป้าหมาย หรือติดขัดจนไปต่อไม่ได้

## 3. The Self-Annealing Workflow (ขั้นตอนการปฏิบัติ)
ให้ AI ปฏิบัติตาม 3 ขั้นตอนนี้อย่างเคร่งครัดเมื่อได้รับคำสั่ง "Task: Self-Anneal":

### Step 1: Analyze (วิเคราะห์สาเหตุ)
วิเคราะห์หาสาเหตุที่แท้จริง (Root Cause Analysis) ว่าทำไม SOP/Directives เดิมถึงทำให้เกิดปัญหา:
*   **Gap Identification:** กฎข้อไหนใน `directives/` ที่ "หายไป" (Missing)?
*   **Ambiguity:** กฎข้อไหนที่ "คลุมเครือ" จนทำให้ AI ตีความผิด?
*   **Conflict:** มีกฎข้อไหนที่ "ขัดแย้ง" กันเองหรือไม่?

### Step 2: Propose Directive Update (เสนอการแก้ไข SOP)
ห้ามแก้แค่ที่ปลายเหตุ (แก้แค่ Text ในบทนั้น) แต่ต้องเสนอการแก้ที่ต้นเหตุ (Directive) เพื่อป้องกันไม่ให้เกิดปัญหาเดิมในบทถัดไป:
*   ระบุชื่อไฟล์ Directive ที่ต้องการแก้ไข (เช่น `01_write_chapter.md`, `02_refine_voice.md`)
*   ระบุเนื้อหาที่ต้องการเพิ่ม (Add), ลบ (Exclude), หรือปรับเปลี่ยน (Modify)
*   **Example:** "เพิ่มกฎใน `02_refine_voice.md` ว่า *'ต้องมี Metaphor เปรียบเทียบกับ Software Engineering อย่างน้อย 1 ครั้งในทุก Section'* เพื่อแก้ปัญหาเนื้อหาดูแห้งแล้งเกินไป"

### Step 3: Execute Optimization (ดำเนินการปรับปรุงระบบ)
เมื่อ Human Director อนุมัติแผนการแก้ไข:
1.  ทำการแก้ไขไฟล์ Directive นั้นจริงๆ (`write_to_file` / `replace_file_content`)
2.  บันทึกสิ่งที่เรียนรู้ใหม่ลงใน `task.md` หรือ Log เพื่อเป็นหลักฐานว่าระบบได้ "ฉลาดขึ้น" แล้ว (Version Up)

## 4. Maintenance (การดูแลรักษาระบบ)
*   อย่ากลัวที่จะลบกฎเก่าที่ล้าสมัย (Deprecation)
*   ทำให้ Directive สั้น กระชับ และ High-impact เสมอ (Lean Principle)
